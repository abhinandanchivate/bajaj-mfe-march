Project Breakdown
1. Micro-Frontend Architecture (4 Angular Apps)

Each micro-frontend will be a separate Angular application that interacts via a shell/container app.

Product Catalog Micro-Frontend
Displays a list of products
Shows product details
Filters and sorts products
Components:
ProductListComponent
ProductDetailsComponent
FilterComponent
CartButtonComponent
State Management: Uses Redux to fetch and store products.
Cart & Checkout Micro-Frontend
Manages cart and checkout process
Shows cart items, quantity adjustments, and total price
Implements checkout form (shipping & payment)
Components:
CartComponent
CheckoutComponent
AddressFormComponent
PaymentComponent
State Management: Uses Redux to store cart items and order details.
User Authentication & Profile Micro-Frontend
Manages user authentication (Login/Register)
Shows user profile and order history
Components:
LoginComponent
RegisterComponent
UserProfileComponent
OrderHistoryComponent
State Management: Uses Redux to store user authentication state.
Order Management & Admin Panel Micro-Frontend
Displays past orders
Allows admin to manage orders
Components:
OrderListComponent
OrderDetailsComponent
AdminDashboardComponent
AnalyticsComponent
State Management: Uses Redux to manage order status.
2. Redux Implementation

Each micro-frontend will have its own Redux store, communicating via an event bus (or shared state via Redux Toolkit).

Actions: FETCH_PRODUCTS, ADD_TO_CART, REMOVE_FROM_CART, CHECKOUT, LOGIN_SUCCESS, UPDATE_ORDER_STATUS
Reducers: productReducer, cartReducer, authReducer, orderReducer
Selectors: Used for fetching data from the store.
3. Docker & Deployment

Each micro-frontend is packaged as a Docker container.
The host/container app loads each micro-frontend dynamically.
Uses Docker Compose to orchestrate services.
Dockerfile for each Angular micro-frontend

# Use Node.js for building
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build --prod

# Use Nginx to serve the built Angular app
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist/microfrontend-name /usr/share/nginx/html
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml)

version: "3.8"
services:
  product-catalog:
    build: ./product-catalog
    ports:
      - "8081:80"

  cart-checkout:
    build: ./cart-checkout
    ports:
      - "8082:80"

  user-auth:
    build: ./user-auth
    ports:
      - "8083:80"

  order-management:
    build: ./order-management
    ports:
      - "8084:80"

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ports:
      - "80:80"
Case Study: Implementing Micro-Frontends in E-Commerce
Scenario

A growing e-commerce platform is facing slow frontend deployments due to a monolithic Angular application. The team decides to adopt Micro-Frontends using Angular and Redux to improve modularity, performance, and scalability.

Challenges

Independent Deployability: Each team wants to deploy their micro-frontend without affecting others.
State Management: Redux needs to manage global state across micro-frontends.
Seamless User Experience: Routing and navigation should feel like a single app.
Cross-Microfrontend Communication: The cart service should reflect the user's selections in the product catalog.
Solution Approach

Used Module Federation in Angular 19 to split micro-frontends.
Implemented Redux with shared state.
Deployed micro-frontends as Docker containers and managed them using Docker-Compose.
Used Nginx reverse proxy to route requests between micro-frontends dynamically.
Benefits

✔ Faster Development Cycles - Teams work independently.
✔ Scalability - Individual services can scale based on demand.
✔ Improved Performance - Each micro-frontend loads only required resources.
✔ Better Code Maintainability - Smaller, focused codebases.
